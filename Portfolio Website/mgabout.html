				<h2 class="abouthwidth1">About the Designer</h2>
				<p class="We-believe-that">Hi, I am Marci the owner and the designer of 
				this website.  I am currently going to school full-time at BYU-Idaho and 
				majoring in Graphic and Web Design. I would describe myself as a motivated, 
				athletic, and artistic. My art ability has allowed me to become a creative 
				Graphic and Web Designer. As for my athletic ability, my performances have 
				trained me to stick to a task and to always work hard no matter what. I am 
				currently married to my husband, Ben, who is a big supporter of my work and 
				hobbies. We currently live in Utah and we will soon be moving to the Bay Area. 
				There we hope to explore new opportunities.  </p>

				<h2 class="abouthwidth2">About the Website</h2>
				<p>This website will be used to share my work and hobbies within the art 
				boundaries of a Graphic and Web Design. My Design page will show you the 
				finished projects of all my works with a brief description of each piece of 
				work. Here I hope to show my best work in the Web and Graphic Design field. 
				My page labeled as Art will show you the rough sketches and processes of 
				creating a final piece of work. You can also find some finished paintings 
				and drawings as well. The Art page will mainly be used for unfinished works 
				and fun side hobbies. 
				 <br>
				 <br>
				 I hope you can find something that you can enjoy at a professional and 
				 as a inspirational level. There is something here for everyone.
